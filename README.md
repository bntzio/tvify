TVify retrieves TV shows from an API and let you mark the ones you like, in that way you can always know which TV show you have seen, and which ones haven't :smile:

I made TVify to learn jQuery and AJAX.

###Cool features to add

* Create an authentication system (log-in, sign-up)
* Create comments section for each TV show for discussions

*Feel free to PR!*
